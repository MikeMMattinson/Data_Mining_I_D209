# WGU D209 Task 1 Rev 4 - Mattinson

<div style="font-family:Impact;">Primary Goal. <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 18px;color: #000000;line-height: 24px;">The question has come up for a telecommunications company regarding churn. <b>Churn</b> is defined when a customer chooses to stop services. If the company has data on customers that have and have not churned in the past, is it possible to classify a new (or existing) customer based on their similarity to other customers with similar attributes that have and have not churned in the past. This analysis will consider two (2) attributes, <b>MonthlyCharge</b> and <b>Tenure</b> within the company's customer data of 10,000 customers. In addition, if the prediction is made, the analysis will also attempt to quantify the accuracy of the prediction.</span></div>
